\title{Build a nucleotide data.table from an image (drop pure black/white pixels)}
\usage{
image_nt_dt(path, nt_vec, stride = 1L)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Character. Path to a TIFF image.}

\item{nt_vec}{Character vector of nucleotides/labels. Must be at least as long
as the number of kept pixels (no recycling).}

\item{stride}{Integer (>=1). Subsampling step; 1 = every pixel.}
}
\value{
A data.table with columns \code{x}, \code{y}, \code{col}, \code{nt}.
}
\description{
Reads a TIFF image, samples pixels on a grid, converts each sampled pixel
to a hex color, drops pure black/white (`#000000`, `#FFFFFF`), and assigns
nucleotides in order from `nt_vec`.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
DT <- image_nt_dt("~/Desktop/Pistachio-Nuts.tiff",
                  nt_vec = sample(c("A","T","C","G"), 1e7, TRUE),
                  stride = 10)
}
